Justifications of selected approach, tools and techniques
<br>I have compared different classification models while predicting phishing websites rather than limiting myself to only one model. This gives us an idea about which model is best suited for a perticular requirements.
<br>For Ex.- We got best accuracy in MLP but best Precision in Decision Tree which is an important comparison because we don't want a model which may declare a phishing website as legitimate because that may prove to be dangerous for a user. But also, we don't want a model whose accuracy is low since we get very less output. What we need is a good amount of accurate output with good precision also.
